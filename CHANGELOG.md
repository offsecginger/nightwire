# Changelog

All notable changes to sidechannel will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- Claude CLI integration for code analysis, generation, and project work
- Signal messaging integration via signal-cli-rest-api (Docker)
- Episodic memory system with vector embeddings and semantic search
- Autonomous task execution with PRD/Story/Task breakdown
- **Parallel task execution** with configurable worker count (1-10 concurrent)
- **Independent verification system** - separate Claude context reviews each task's output
- **Error classification and retry** - transient errors retried with exponential backoff
- **Baseline test snapshots** - pre-task test state captured for regression detection
- **Stale task recovery** - stuck tasks automatically re-queued on loop restart
- **Circular dependency detection** - DFS-based cycle detection prevents deadlocks
- **Git safety** - checkpoint/commit locking prevents concurrent git corruption
- **Auto-fix loop** - verification failures trigger up to 2 fix attempts
- **Task type detection** - automatic classification (feature, bugfix, refactor, test, docs, config)
- **Adaptive effort levels** - task complexity mapped to execution effort
- Project management with multi-project support
- Nova assistant (optional Grok integration, disabled by default)
- Interactive installer with Signal QR code device linking
- Systemd service support
- Comprehensive test suite

### Security
- Phone number allowlist for access control
- **Rate limiting** - per-user request throttling with configurable window
- **Path validation hardening** - prefix attack prevention on project paths
- **Phone number masking** - numbers partially redacted in all log output
- **Fail-closed verification** - security concerns and logic errors block task completion
- Environment-based secret management (.env not committed)
- No message content logging by default
- End-to-end encrypted Signal transport

### Fixed
- Path validation bypass via directory prefix attack
- Zombie subprocess on timeout (now properly killed)
- Init race condition in memory manager (double-checked locking)
- Session ID collision risk (full UUID instead of truncated prefix)

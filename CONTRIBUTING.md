### Key Design Decisions
- **Fail-closed verification**: Security concerns or logic errors in code review block task completion
- **Parallel execution**: Tasks dispatched to concurrent workers with dependency-aware batching
- **Regression detection**: Pre-task test baselines compared to post-task results
- **Error retry**: Transient failures (rate limits, timeouts) retried with exponential backoff

## Development Setup

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install in editable mode with dev dependencies (pyproject.toml)
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Fallback: if using requirements.txt
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# pip install pytest pytest-asyncio black ruff

# Run linting
ruff check sidechannel/
black --check sidechannel/

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
```

## Code Style

- Use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for formatting
- Use [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting
- Follow PEP 8 conventions
- Add type hints to function signatures
- Write docstrings for public functions

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
- Update documentation if needed
- Add tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass
- Write clear commit messages

## Reporting Issues

When reporting bugs, please include:

- Python version
- Operating system
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Relevant logs

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome! Please describe:

- The problem you're trying to solve
- Your proposed solution
- Any alternatives you've considered
